### Users (non-developers)

- You can run LBTWallet on your computer and can create a wallet completely offline.

1. Go to https://github.com/letbetcoin/lbtwallet/releases/latest.
2. Click on lbtwallet-vX.X.zip.
3. Move zip to an airgapped computer.
4. Unzip it and double-click index.html.
5. LBTWallet is now running entirely on your computer.

In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just index.html. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. If you are storing a backup of the LBTWallet repo for the future, we recommend just storing the ZIP so you can be sure the folder contents stay intact.

As we are constantly updating LBT, we recommend you periodically update your saved version of the repo.
